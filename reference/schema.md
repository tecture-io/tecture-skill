# File-Based Architecture Schema

Detailed reference for the file layout and JSON schemas used by the `architecture-files` skill.

This is the file-based mirror of the Tecture database schema documented in [/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [/docs/DIAGRAM_SCHEMA.md](/docs/DIAGRAM_SCHEMA.md). The key differences:

- UUIDs are replaced with kebab-case **slugs** (diagram file names; stable node ids).
- Node `description` is not inlined in JSON — it lives in `descriptions/<node-id>.md`.
- Manual `positions` and other viewer state are not stored (the web viewer rebuilds layout on import).

## Directory layout

```
architecture/
├── manifest.json
├── diagrams/
│   └── <diagram-slug>.json
└── descriptions/
    └── <node-id>.md
```

All paths are relative to the architecture root (default `./architecture` at project root).

## `manifest.json`

Draft 2020-12 JSON Schema: [../schemas/manifest.schema.json](../schemas/manifest.schema.json).

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | yes | Architecture name. |
| `description` | string | no | Plain-text, 2–4 paragraphs separated by `\n\n`. No markdown. |
| `topDiagram` | slug | yes | Slug of the entry-point diagram. Must appear in `diagrams[]`. |
| `diagrams` | slug[] | yes | Every diagram slug that belongs to this architecture. Non-empty, unique. |

Unknown top-level fields are rejected. Slugs match `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`.

## `diagrams/<slug>.json`

Draft 2020-12 JSON Schema: [../schemas/diagram.schema.json](../schemas/diagram.schema.json).

### Top-level

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | yes | Human-readable diagram title (e.g. `"System Context"`, `"API Service – Components"`). |
| `level` | 1 \| 2 \| 3 | no | C4 level hint. 1 = System Context, 2 = Container, 3 = Component. |
| `meta.direction` | `"TB"` \| `"LR"` | no | Layout direction. Default `TB`. |
| `meta.layout` | string | no | Layout engine hint (opaque to the skill). |
| `nodes` | Node[] | yes | Non-empty. |
| `edges` | Edge[] | no | Defaults to `[]`. |

### Node

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | slug | yes | **Globally unique** across every diagram in the architecture. Matches the filename under `descriptions/`. |
| `label` | string | yes | Display name. |
| `parentId` | slug \| null | no | Another node's `id` **in the same diagram**. That parent must have `meta.isContainer = true`. |
| `subDiagramId` | slug \| null | no | Another diagram's slug (drill-down target). Must exist under `diagrams/`. Self-reference is forbidden. |
| `meta.type` | enum | no | One of `system`, `person`, `service`, `database`, `queue`, `gateway`, `frontend`, `cache`, `storage`, `external`. |
| `meta.technology` | slug | no | Free-form tech identity, ideally a [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org) slug (`postgresql`, `react`, `aws-s3`). |
| `meta.isContainer` | boolean | no | If `true`, this node groups child nodes (those that set `parentId` to this id). |

Nodes **must not** carry a `description` field — descriptions live in `descriptions/<id>.md`.

### Edge

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | slug | yes | Unique within the diagram. Convention: `e-<source>-<target>`. |
| `source` | string | yes | Must match a node `id` in the same diagram. |
| `target` | string | yes | Must match a node `id` in the same diagram. |
| `label` | string | no | Short relationship label (`"REST API"`, `"gRPC"`, `"reads/writes"`, `"order.created"`). |
| `meta.type` | enum | no | One of `calls`, `reads`, `writes`, `publishes`, `subscribes`, `data-flow`. |

Edges cannot cross diagram boundaries. Cross-level relationships are expressed with `subDiagramId`, not edges.

## `descriptions/<node-id>.md`

GitHub-flavored markdown. No required structure, but the convention is:

```markdown
One- or two-sentence summary of what this component does.

## Responsibilities
- …
- …

## Tech Stack
- …
```

Filename must be exactly `<node.id>.md`. Orphan files (no matching node id anywhere) generate a warning.

### Mermaid diagrams

Any fenced block tagged `mermaid` is rendered as an SVG diagram inside the viewer's node detail panel and can be enlarged in a full-screen lightbox. Use this to describe behavior the static C4 diagrams don't show: request/response sequences, lifecycle/state transitions, data flow with branches, queue fan-out, retry logic.

- Supported: every mermaid diagram type (`sequenceDiagram`, `flowchart`, `stateDiagram-v2`, `erDiagram`, `classDiagram`, `gantt`, `journey`, `gitGraph`, `mindmap`, etc.). The viewer bundles the full mermaid distribution.
- Rendering is sandboxed (`securityLevel: "strict"`) — click handlers and inline HTML inside mermaid source are ignored. Stick to standard mermaid syntax.
- Theme variables are set by the viewer to match the blueprint palette (dark background, cyan/blue/emerald accents, mono font). Don't try to override them from inside the fence.
- Style guidance: keep each chart focused (5–10 participants/states). Prefer one chart per description — if a description grows several charts, the underlying component is probably doing too much and should be split into finer nodes.
- Validation is syntactic only (the prose is GFM). Malformed mermaid syntax will surface as an amber error card with the source preserved when the viewer tries to render it.

Example:

````markdown
Stripe webhook receiver that reconciles payment state.

## Retry Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Pending
  Pending --> Confirmed: webhook.succeeded
  Pending --> Failed: webhook.failed
  Failed --> Pending: retry (<= 3)
  Failed --> [*]: give up (> 3)
  Confirmed --> [*]
```
````

## How diagrams relate

Two orthogonal mechanisms:

1. **Grouping** — `manifest.diagrams[]` lists sibling diagrams in one architecture. `manifest.topDiagram` identifies the entry point.
2. **Drill-down** — a node's `subDiagramId` points to another diagram's slug. Clicking that node in the viewer navigates into the referenced diagram. The drill-down graph must be acyclic.

A third, purely visual mechanism (not cross-diagram): `parentId` + `meta.isContainer` nests child nodes inside a parent container **within the same diagram**.

## Canonical authoring order

Create children before parents, because parents reference child slugs:

1. Write L3 diagrams (if any) and their node description files.
2. Write L2 (Container) diagrams, set `subDiagramId` on nodes pointing at L3 slugs, and their description files.
3. Write L1 (System Context) diagram, set `subDiagramId` on the main system node pointing at the L2 slug, and its description files.
4. Write `manifest.json` with `diagrams[]` containing every slug and `topDiagram` set to the L1 slug.
5. Run the validator (`node scripts/validate.mjs`).

## Validation rules (what the script checks)

- Every JSON file parses and matches its JSON Schema (shape, enums, slugs, no unknown fields).
- `manifest.topDiagram` is present in `manifest.diagrams`.
- Every slug in `manifest.diagrams` has a file; every file on disk is listed (unlisted files → warning).
- Every `node.parentId` resolves to a same-diagram node with `meta.isContainer = true`.
- Every `node.subDiagramId` resolves to an existing diagram and is not self-referential.
- Every `edge.source` / `edge.target` resolves to a same-diagram node.
- Node ids are globally unique across all diagrams.
- Every node id has a matching `descriptions/<id>.md` (missing → error, orphan → warning).
- The drill-down graph formed by `subDiagramId` is a DAG (no cycles).
